# Unity-Run

ABOUT THE PROGRAM

A simple 3D bhop game, which includes a tutorial level and 3 regular levels, which do get harder as you go. The main point of this game is to finish the course by sliding or bhoping through different obstacles. It's minimalistic and the project itself is mostly getting a better feel of Probuilder, Shader Graph and Visual Effect Graph packages, which were used to make the whole environment as it is.
